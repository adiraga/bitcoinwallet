#summary Frequently asked questions

<p>*Q* *What does this application do?*
<p>*A* It allows you to view your balance on your android phone

<p>*Q* *How does it work?*
<p>*A* By using <a href="http://blockexplorer.com">blockexplorer</a> to query for transactions to/from your bitcoin addresses.

<p>*Q* *So you need my addresses?*
<p>*A* Yes, you need to export your addresses from your wallet for the tool to be able to work

<p>*Q* *How do I export my addresses?*
<p>*A* I provide a tool (written in C) that can parse the addresses from your wallet and print them out.  You can also download a binary from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bitcoinwallet/downloads/list">here</a> if you don't want to compile from source.

<p>*Q* *Why do I have to use your tool*
<p>*A* Because bitcoin doesn't allow you to export all your addresses at the moment.  The developers are working on a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/220">patch</a> to support it but until then it has to be done manually.

<p>*Q* *Why can't I just copy all the addresses from bitcoin manually*
<p>*A* Because when you spend bitcoins the change from the transaction is sent back to hidden pool addresses that the bitcoin client doesn't show in the main UI - if you only took the addresses from the UI then your balance would show as too low depending on how many bitcoin sends you have done.  If you have never sent any bitcoins from a wallet, then this method would work.

<p>*Q* *How do I get my addresses to my Android phone?*
<p>*A* You upload your addresses to pastebin, and the phone pulls them from there.

<p>*Q* *How do I protect my addresses?*
<p>*A* If you create a pastebin account then you can delete/modify/edit your addresses once you've placed them on pastebin.  Even if you don't create an account, you can mark the paste as private so it won't be searchable, and as long as nobody knows the pastebin hash, nobody can get your addresses

<p>*Q* *Why should I worry about my addresses?*
<p>*A* Although your addresses contain no information that would allow people to take your bitcoins, they do contain information that would allow people to track your transactions.  If you feel that your addresses have been compromised then you can always set up a new wallet and transfer your balance to that.

<p>*Q** What should I type into the box in the application?*
<p>*A* You need to type the pastebin 'hash' which is the sequence of letters and numbers that pastebin gives you. e.g. L3LfHRP8

<p>*Q** But it's a real pain to enter the string!*
<p>*A* Yes I know but you only need to do it once since it remembers the address.  Also, I'm working on adding QR code scanning support so you can quickly enter the address into your phone.

<p>*Q* *The balance is showing as incorrect - what's the problem?*
<p>*A* The balance can be wrong for several reasons:
  * either blockexplorer hasn't seen your transaction yet, this will happen for unconfirmed transactions (ones with 'unconfirmed/0' on them).  In addition, blockexplorer takes a few seconds after the first confirmation to database the transaction
  * or, you have recently made a payment, and your bitcoin client has created a new address to receive the change (which it does, from time to time) and your bitcoins have been sent to one of these addresses.  In this case, you need to re-export your keys for the application to know where your bitcoins are.

<p>*Q* *I've uploaded a new list of addresses and want to clear my history, how do I do that?*
<p>*A* Just wipe the application's storage by going to application manager, then 'Clear Data'.

<p>*Q* *I have a cool idea for a new feature!*
<p>*A* Please email me on will@phase.net with any suggestions you have, or post on the bitcoin forum <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=21969">here</a>.

<p>*Q* *How can I donate to you?*
<p>*A* Any donations, however small, are appreciated - just send them to 1NbXdG4Bu9LFpF3YNnT1LtZNqJroQrVqmg
